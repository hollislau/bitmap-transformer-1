## CodeFellows-401d8 Bitmap transformer homework
### Usage:
+ Clone and navigate to bitmap-transformer folder
+ Use command with the format `.bin/bitmap <filename.bmp> <transform options>`
+ Available transform options: `invert/grayscale/bluescale/greenscale/redscale`

### Bonus points completed:
- [x] Can handle palette and non-palette bitmaps
- Can handle multiple types of bitmaps (not just BM)
- Handle LE and BE computers with a single if statement
- [x] Create a command line interface
- [x] Command line interface that can select the transform
- [x] Can handle various sized bitmaps. **NOTE**** Various sized **non-palette** bitmaps only have the `invert and grayscale` working, haven't figure out the algorithms for `bluescale/greenscale/redscale` yet. All the options for **palette** bitmap should be working as intended even for various sized.
- [x] Make your command install-able on npm and use a "bin"
